The initial state of the field is simply set by a variable - a two-dimensional array (the size of the array determines the size of the playing field).
Output the initial state of the field to the console in the specified format:

+ stands for living cells
- stands for empty cells

For each pressing of any button - output to the console in the same format the new state of the field for the next generation.

If the field is empty - display the message "Game over"

If the field does not change during the generation - display the message "Game over"
